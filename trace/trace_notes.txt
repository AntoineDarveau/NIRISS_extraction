Notes on trace.f90

! Constants ---------------------------

nksd2 = nKsize/2    ! precompute size of PSF/2 -> 64/2


! Parameters to control trace ----------

ncut = 35          ! Width of spectrum to zero out
bcut = 3.0d0       ! S/N threshold for finding a trace
tcut = 10.0d0      ! Threshold for traces to jump
ncutpsf = 24       ! Width of initial PSF to fit - must be less than nKsize/2
